# Self-Assessment: Onion Architecture, MVC, and Web API (.NET Core) with Bottlenecks (Encountered)
# Conceptual Understanding:
### Onion Architecture: No. I haven't heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design.
### MVC Pattern: Yes. I'm familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications.
### Web API: No. I don't understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API.


# Application & Bottlenecks

## Onion Architecture:

### Benefits:
- Separation of Concerns
- Testability
- Maintainability

### Bottlenecks (Encountered):
- No. Onion Architecture has proven to be beneficial in our projects, providing clear separation of concerns and facilitating testability.



# MVC:

## Components:
- Model
- View
- Controller

## Roles:
- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
- **View**: Presents the user interface to interact with the application.
- **Controller**: Handles user input, processes requests from the view, and updates the model accordingly.

## Bottlenecks (Encountered):
- Yes. Tight coupling between the Model and Controller can sometimes lead to difficulties in unit testing controllers, as changes in the logic of one component may affect the other, resulting in cascading changes throughout the application.

## Web API:

### Differences from MVC: 
- **Yes**. Web APIs are primarily designed for data exchange and provide endpoints for clients to interact with, whereas traditional MVC applications are focused on serving dynamic web pages and handling user interactions through views and controllers.

### Bottlenecks (Encountered): 
- **No**. I haven't encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs. However, I've heard that complex data exchange and frequent page refreshes can sometimes cause performance overhead in MVC applications.
